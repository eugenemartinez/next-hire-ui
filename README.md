## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/eugenemartinez/next-hire-ui>
    cd next-hire-ui
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables. The most important one is likely the API base URL:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://nexthire-api.vercel.app/ (or use http://127.0.0.1:8000 for local development)
    ```
    (Adjust the URL if your backend server runs on a different port or path).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) or `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the `client` directory, you can run several commands:

*   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
*   `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the application for production to the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
*   `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.

## üìÅ Folder Structure
